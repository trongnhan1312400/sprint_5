# Indy SDK getting started guide
The following are scripts using the SDK and the Python wrapper. 
Each script is a tutorial that would walk the beginner through the example code and tutor him on how critical functions associated with the ledger are used and provide a starting point. Via a brief summary of what is being done and how it can be used is given on each step, the process is realy easy to be understood.
This Python script currently requires python 3.5.
